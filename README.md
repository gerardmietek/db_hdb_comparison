# 🧠 Clustering Analysis in Kraków: DBSCAN vs. HDBSCAN

This project explores the performance and behavior of two popular density-based clustering algorithms — **DBSCAN** and **HDBSCAN** — on geospatial point data located in **Kraków, Poland**.

The goal is to evaluate how each algorithm identifies natural groupings of points based on density and spatial distribution. By applying both methods to real-world coordinates from Kraków, we compare their clustering outcomes, robustness to noise, and sensitivity to parameters.

## ✨ Key Features

- Clustering of real-world geospatial data (latitude & longitude) in Kraków.
- Visual comparison of DBSCAN and HDBSCAN cluster outputs.

## 🧪 Algorithms Used

- **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- **HDBSCAN** (Hierarchical DBSCAN — more flexible and often better for varying densities)

## 🗺️ Why Kraków?

Kraków offers a rich and varied urban structure with distinct zones — from the historical Old Town to modern suburbs — making it a compelling area to test spatial clustering methods on real data.
